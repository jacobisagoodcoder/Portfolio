# Portfolio
## Description
A personal portfolio website that serves as a hub to see my current and future projects, resume, and social media profiles.

## What I learned
From this project, I honed in my skills on basic HTML, CSS and Javascript interaction with the DOM. 

## Future Implementation
In the future I would like to add POST, GET, DELETE requests so that I can fill out a form to fill out the "Code Projects" section respectfully.
